Places to look into:

node/src/service.rs:
    [.] adding InherentDataProvider for karaoke in StartAuraParams

pallets/karaoke/src/lib.rs:
    [.] in pallet::call - call that adds song line to block
    [x] in pallet::inherent - provide inherent (ProvideInherent)
    [.] implement InherentDataProvider
    [X] INHERENT_IDENTIFIER
    [.] implement InherentError

runtime/src/lib.rs:
    [.] pallet Config
    [.] add pallet in construct_runtime


Not known:
 * potentialy: place to implement wrapper for Proposer and ProposerFactory (probably the same place)
 * what changed
 * how to store and access lyrics
 * how to set correct weights and does it really matter
