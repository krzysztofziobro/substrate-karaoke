Places to look into:

node/src/service.rs:
    - adding InherentDataProvider for karaoke in StartAuraParams
    - some usage of ProposerFactory (tutorial says it might be important)

pallets/karaoke/src/lib.rs:
    - in pallet::call - call that adds song line to block
    - in pallet::inherent - provide and verify inherent (ProvideInherent)
    - implement InherentDataProvider
    - INHERENT_IDENTIFIER

runtime/src/lib.rs:
    - pallet Config
    - add pallet in construct_runtime


Not known:
 * potentialy: place to implement wrapper for Proposer and ProposerFactory (probably the same place)
 * what changed
 * how to store and access lyrics
